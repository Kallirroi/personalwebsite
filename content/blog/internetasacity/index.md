description: If the Internet were a city, what would be its roads, buildings, and parks? How do people, businesses and governing bodies produce insights into the qualitative characteristics of distribution beyond the tired triptych of centralized, decentralized, and distributed? In led a workshop where we examined decentralized forms of networking through the lenses of cities, urbanism, and architecture. Participants were provided with “urban” elements to construct landscapes that tease out models of decentralization and governance for the “Internet as a city.”

We held a weird, collaborative, speculative, loud and most importantly really fun workshop called "Internet as a city" at the [Decentralized Web Summit](https://decentralizedweb.net/) in SF in the beginning of August.
