#### Personal research  
This project is an ongoing research exploration of the following questions: Is everything humans inhabit turned into a "city"? How is loss of public space to the digital commons transforming our lived experience of the Internet? How do people, businesses and governing bodies produce insights into the qualitative characteristics of distribution beyond the tired triptych of centralized, decentralized, and distributed?

#### Workshop at 2018 Decentralized Web Summit
We held a weird, collaborative, speculative, loud and most importantly really fun workshop called "Internet as a city" at the [Decentralized Web Summit](https://decentralizedweb.net/) 2018 in San Fransisco. Our goal was to examine decentralized forms of networking through the lenses of cities, urbanism, and architecture. Participants were provided with “urban” elements to construct landscapes that tease out models of decentralization and governance for the “Internet as a city.”
