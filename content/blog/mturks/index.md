I am always curious about thinking metaphorically about technology. I asked Amazon Mechanical Turk users to describe how they imagine Facebook, Apple and Amazon to look like if they were real people. Not sure why I forgot Google though...ðŸ¤· The (hopefully unintentional?) biases these answers reveal are fascinating.


#### Question: If the big tech companies were actual people, how would they look like? Describe them in a couple of sentences.


#### Amazon
- Amazon would be like a Greek statue that is the perfect embodiment of masculinity.
- Amazon would be shaped like a body builder.
- Amazon would definitely be a skinny nerdy guy
- Amazon would be smart and proud
- he would be a geeky tech guy with glasses

<br>

#### Apple
- Apple would be a scrawny kid.
- Apple would be a tall, thin long distance runner.
- Apple would be a good looking tall, dark, handsome man with glasses and intelligence
- Apple would be smart and sophisticated.
- it would be tall and sexy

<br>

#### Facebook
- Facebook would be a bigger person who is quite a bully
- Facebook would be 50 years old, bald and smoke a cigar.
- Facebook would be a short, fat, annoying valley girl
- Facebook would be attractive
- it would be a middle aged man still hanging onto youth
