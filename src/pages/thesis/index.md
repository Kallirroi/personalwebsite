I designed, fabricated and deployed a number of objects that capture, play and share in a p2p way audio messages. My motivation is to explore how a small decentralized network, supported by these physical nodes, performs in a real world scenario (in this case, the MIT campus), how the audience interacts with it and whether the nature of information collected by these objects differs from what could be carried by a conventional website. I am curious about the interaction design component, whether users would care about the fact that this is a non-centralized repository of information, and whether they are ready to sacrifice some of their "user comfort" in order to prioritize locality and data ownership.

This project is also my Master's thesis at the Media Lab. Lastly, I kept a weekly journal of my progress, which you can find <a href="https://there.am/pwr01-internet-as-an-object/" target="_blank"> here</a>.
